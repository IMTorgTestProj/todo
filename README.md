#  JavaScriptMVC Todo Application (variation)

##Getting Started

JMVC is broken down into 4 separate projects that can be used independent of each other. These are:
<ul>
	<li>jQueryMVC - MVC extensions for jQuery</li>
	<li>StealJS - Dependency management, build process, code generators</li>
	<li>FuncUnit - A web testing framework</li>
	<li>DocumentJS - A JavaScript docs framework</li>
</ul>

To get started with the Todo application, you'll first need to add a few project dependancies to your todo project directory. You have two options for how to achieve this, either using *submodules* to checkout the submodules as their own repositories (recommended) or alternatively by cloning their repos locally.

###Cloning

Cloning repositories using GitHub is a fairly straight-forward process and the todo application just requires the following commands to be executed to get you setup:

<pre>
git clone http://github.com/jupiterjs/steal
git clone http://github.com/jupiterjs/jquerymx
git clone http://github.com/jupiterjs/funcunit
git clone http://github.com/jupiterjs/documentjs
</pre>
