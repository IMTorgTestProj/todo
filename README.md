#  JavaScriptMVC Todo Application (variation)

##Getting Started

JMVC is broken down into 4 separate projects that can be used independent of each other. These are:
<ul>
<li>jQueryMVC - MVC extensions for jQuery</li>
<li>StealJS - Dependency management, build process, code generators</li>
<li>FuncUnit - A web testing framework</li>
<li>DocumentJS - A JavaScript docs framework</li>
</ul>

To get started with the Todo application, you'll first need to add a few project dependancies to your todo project directory. You have two options for how to achieve this, either using *submodules* to checkout the submodules as their own repositories (recommended) or alternatively by cloning their repos locally.
